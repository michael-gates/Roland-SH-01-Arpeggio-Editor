# Roland-SH-01-Arpeggio-Editor
A Java program for manipulating the Roland GAIA SH-01 onboard arpeggiator settings via MIDI sysex messages.

Just a hobby project. I couldn't get grauw's gaia-tool to work (http://www.grauw.nl/projects/gaia-tool/),
and all I really need is the arpeggio section. Java is not my strong suit, so use at your own peril.
